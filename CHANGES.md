# 0.2.0

 * Body data attributes are no longer required, these are now provided by the helpers instead.
 * Event names have changed: `show-scrim` is now `scrim:show`, `hide-scrim` and `scrim-hide` are now `scrim:hide`.
 * Programmatic methods exported for show/hide of both modal and scrim.
 * Dependencies have been relaxed to support Rails 7 and `turbo-rails` releases.
